# Gosslar_Roof_Image-_Classification

In the file "Gosslar_Dataset_Generation.ipynb"   dataset is generated for the top 4 classes.

Firstly the test and validation dataset was created on te original sample remaining sample of images were used as training.

Since these classes were having unbalanced images so image augmentation was used to balance the training set.

There is no overlap of images between the sets.

Different models have been tried on Gosslar dataset in which till now- the  CNN has performed the best with 71 % test accuracy.
The rest Transfer Learning models have not shown good result due to overfitting and need more improvement for better results.
